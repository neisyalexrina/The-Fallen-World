    reason: "Pedophile, pervert (and proudly so-because what’s worse than being a creep? Being one openly), disrespectful, disloyal (a traitor who switches sides just to hurt people), shameless, dishonest, and a cyberbully. Also a textbook snowflake and desperate for attention. You’re not welcome here.",

    name: "Penny The Fox",
    reason: "Massive ego, emotionally fragile to the point of being a complete snowflake in every situation. Tends to spiral into over-the-top emo meltdowns and somehow believes it’s okay to passive-mock call someone out, just because they personally dislike a certain thing. (But at least, in KopiKo's situation, I have been a wrong person too, so it's fair)",

    name: "Narami Akaisuki",
    reason: "Emotionally needy and repeatedly disrespectful. Has no concept of personal boundaries or privacy, and the most ridiculous excuse ever heard: “You said it was a secret, but you didn’t say I couldn’t tell anyone.” Preaches about respecting privacy while being the very reason someone got hurt due to a blatant lack of it. You don’t get to play the victim when you’re the one breaking trust.",

    name: "Mio",
    reason: "Obsessed with being treated like a fragile little sister, while in reality just manipulative and selfish. Uses people for personal gain, money, attention, and emotional sympathy. Clingy to the point of being territorial, acting like others belong to her and throwing a fit if anyone else gets close. Even had the nerve to slip herself into someone else's relationship, knowing full well they were taken.",
